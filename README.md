# Web-Data-ETL-Pipeline


Web Data ETL Pipeline
Overview
This project implements a web data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for preprocessing heterogeneous data sourced from the web. The pipeline automates data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, detecting outliers, and normalizing features to enhance data quality and reliability for downstream analysis.

Features
Automated handling of missing values in numeric features using the mean imputation strategy.
Detection and handling of outliers in numeric features through the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Normalization of numeric features using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scaling across datasets.
Imputation of missing values in categorical features using the most frequent strategy.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook (for development and experimentation)
